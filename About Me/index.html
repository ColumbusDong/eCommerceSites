			Hi, my name is Columbus Dong and I am a Senior at Manteo High School and will be turning 18 this October.
			I was born on Columbus Day in 1997, and thus my given name was Columbus.<br /><br />
			My schedule at school is as follows: 
		</p>

		<ol style = "list-style-type: upper-roman">
			<li> First Period: AP Literature </li>
			<li> Second Period: Honors Computer Science Principles </li>
			<li> Third Period: AP BC Calculus </li>
			<li> Fourth Period: Peer Tutoring </li>
			<li> Fifth Period: e-Commerce on NCVPS and Honors Psychology on NCVPS</li>
		</ol>

			I have been programming for roughly three or four years now and I plan to go to college for Computer Science and possibly a minor in Mathematics.<br />
			I say I have been programming, but majority of it is through NCVPS's online classes, but I have done some side projects here and there on my own. <br /><br />
			Some of the languages I know currently are:
		</p>

		<ul style = "list-style-type: square">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>Visual Basic</li>
			<li>HTML and CSS (though I am a bit rusty, it has been three years)</li>
			<li>A little bit of JavaScript</li>
			<li> I am working on learning Python and Swift</li>
		</ul>

			I went to Governor's School West in Winston-Salem this Summer for Mathematics and the math professors there taught me a lot of cool stuff in math that I have never heard of before. I had talked with someone who had graduated from Princeton for Computer Science and at that point, I had no doubt that I wanted to go into Computer Science. I honestly like being a jack-of-all-trades and not just specializing too heavily in one specific thing and just being able to do a lot of stuff, which is seen in my hobbies. I actually worked one Summer as an intern at a business that specialized in making websites and I helped out with the CSS and some of the layout in HTML. It was a really fun experience and I got to actually apply the HTML and CSS I learned in a real-life job, so that was cool.</br></br>
