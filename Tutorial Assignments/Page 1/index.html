			I am a Senior at Manteo High School. My goals for this include: writing more programs and learning more programming languages. </br>The topics I would like to cover in e-Commerce I are nothing in specific, however, it sounds like an interesting course. </br>I have previously learned HTML and CSS but will be a little bit rusty at it, its been about two or three years.

		One of the greatest speeches of all time would include:
			<blockquote>
				I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.
	</p>
				I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
	<p>
				I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
	</p>
				I have a dream today.
